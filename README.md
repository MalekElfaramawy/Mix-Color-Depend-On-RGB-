RGB color space
The first color space we are going to discuss is RGB, which stands for the Red, Green, and Blue components of an image. In all likelihood you are already very familiar with the RGB color space as most color applications and computer vision/image processing libraries use RGB by default.

To define a color in the RGB color model, all we need to do is define the amount of Red, Green, and Blue contained in a single pixel. Each Red, Green, and Blue channel can have values defined in the range [0, 255] (for a total of 256 “shades”), where 0 indicates no representation and 255 demonstrates full representation.

The RGB color space is an example of an additive color space: the more of each color is added, the brighter the pixel becomes
